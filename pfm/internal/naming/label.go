// BookmarkLabel scrapes a chat's own 🔖 label off a captured pane. It is the
// single implementation of that read (K3): the label resolver, the inject
// sender signature, and the claude half of window-name convergence all ask the
// same question of the same screen text, and three spellings of it drifted
// apart once already.
//
// The anchor is 🔖 PLUS an account medal, never 🌿: a labelled chat outside a
// repository renders no 🌿 and would go unaddressable. The medal set is
// whatever the STATUSLINE can emit, which outlives the fleet's account roster —
// a chat born under a retired account still renders its old medal until it
// exits, so dropping that medal here would silently stop resolving it.
//
// The LAST matching line wins: the statusline is at the bottom of the capture,
// and a transcript quoting an older label appears above it.

// DeliveredFooterMarker opens the reply hint inject stamps onto every
// message it delivers (internal/inject signatureParts). It lives here, beside
// the scraper, because this package owns the one question both sides of it
// ask: which lines on a pane are the pane's OWN identity, and which are text
// somebody else put there. A line carrying this marker is a message this
// fleet delivered INTO the pane — never the pane's own statusline — and
// BookmarkLabelFor skips it.
const DeliveredFooterMarker = "to reply: chat_inject "

// BookmarkLabelFor is BookmarkLabel with the configured account emoji set
// supplied by the caller. Legacy medals remain accepted for old live labels.
//
// A delivered footer is skipped outright. Older footers stamped "🔖 <sender
// label>" into the recipient's pane, and because the LAST 🔖 line wins, a
// chat's resolved label could become whatever the most recent message it
// received claimed its sender was called. inject no longer writes that
// marker, but footers already on screen and in scrollback still carry it, so
// the read side refuses them by their own signature rather than trusting them
// to have aged out.
//
// This defends against the footer THIS fleet writes, which it can recognise
// exactly. It is not a defence against arbitrary screen text: a capture is
// untrusted input, and the medal gate below tells a statusline apart from
// prose only by coincidence, not by construction. See the note on
// ContainsMedalFor.

// ContainsMedal reports whether a captured line carries an account medal, the
// marker that tells a 🔖 label line apart from ordinary transcript text.
//
// It is a heuristic over untrusted text, not a proof of provenance: any line
// that happens to render a medal beside a 🔖 passes it. That is tolerable
// only because the one systematic source of foreign 🔖 lines — this fleet's
// own delivered footer — is now excluded above by its own marker. A pane's
// identity ultimately has authoritative sources (its SID crumb, its socket,
// its window name); screen text is not one of them. 🍀 is
// the retired account-4 medal: the account is gone, but chats labelled while it
// was live still render it, and without it here those chats are unresolvable.
